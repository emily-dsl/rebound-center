Check out our timetable of open sessions.  You are welcome to come along and enjoy any of these sessions at any time.  There is no commitment to attend every week.

We offer a range of times and activities to suit you and your needs.  If you feel you would like to attend regular structured lessons then speak to our staff about joining one of our classes.  Take a look at [Club Sessions](/club_sessions/) to see which lessons would suit you.

## Parent and Tot Trampolining

Come along to our trampolining sessions where your little ones can gain confidence on the trampoline and have a lot of fun.  As they attend more often they will gain valuable gymnastic and control skills, learning new moves and beginning to perform short routines.  This is a great way to see if your children will benefit from joining us for lessons and certified badge work.
