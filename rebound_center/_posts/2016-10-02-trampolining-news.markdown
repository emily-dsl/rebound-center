## Club Membership is now due

As from the 1st November there is a new club membership scheme.  This has become necessary to make compulsory due to changes by the government to our Community Amateur Sports Charitable status.  If we lose this status it will mean more costs to our members and much higher fees, which we would like to avoid.

Annual membership is due at a cost of £15 - single or £30 - family, this is compulsory for all club members to purchase.  Session fees are in addition, whether you attend or not.

The saving to you for a single membership is £40.80 + 2 free sessions allocated for the holidays per membership year.

The saving for a family membership with just one adult staying pers session is £86.40 + 2 free sessions allocated for holiday in the membership year.

If you have any further questions please speak to a member of our team.
