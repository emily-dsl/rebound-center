Check out our timetable of open sessions.  You are welcome to come along and enjoy any of these sessions at any time.  There is no commitment to attend every week.

We offer a range of times and activities to suit you and your needs.  If you feel you would like to attend regular structured lessons then speak to our staff about joining one of our classes.  Take a look at [Club Sessions](/club_sessions/) to see which lessons would suit you.

There is more information under the timetable describing what you can expect from each of the sessions. All of our Open Sessions are run by qualified and experienced coaches.

## Parent and Tot Trampolining

Come along to our trampolining sessions where your little ones can gain confidence on the trampoline and have a lot of fun.  As they attend more often they will gain valuable gymnastic and control skills, learning new moves and beginning to perform short routines.  We always work with the children at their pace; encouraging them to show us what they can do, and try out new moves.  This is a great way to see if your children will benefit from joining us for a Club Session and certified badge work.

## Parent and Tot Gymnastics

Most of what we do in these sessions involves getting the children familiar to the gymnastics equipment and their own bodiees.  Children learn how to do basic moves like forward and backwards rolls.  They move around activity stations where they might have to touch their toes, jump, balance or hop.  The emphasis is very much on fun and we move at a pace that suits the children in the class.

## Over 5's Trampolining

These sessions are mainly for children who already attend Club Sessions or who are on the waiting list, so that they can get extra time on the trampolines.  However, all are welcome from first time jumper to pro's.  Coaches will help the children improve their technique and guide them in beginning new moves or routines.
